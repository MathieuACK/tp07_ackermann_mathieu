## Multi-stage Dockerfile for building a TypeScript + Express API
## - builder stage installs dev deps and builds the TypeScript into /app/dist
## - runner stage installs only production deps and runs the compiled JS

FROM node:22 AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package manifests and install full deps (including dev) for build
COPY ./api/package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Copy source and build
COPY ./api ./
RUN npm run build

FROM node:22-slim AS runner
WORKDIR /app

# Use production environment
ARG NODE_ENV=production
ENV NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV}

# Build-time arguments from CI/CD secrets
ARG PORT

ARG DB_PORT
ARG DB_USER
ARG DB_PASSWORD
ARG DB_NAME

# Set as environment variables (accessible at runtime)

ENV DB_HOST=${DB_HOST}
ENV DB_PORT=${DB_PORT}
ENV DB_USER=${DB_USER}
ENV DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}

# Copy only production dependencies and the built artifacts
COPY ./api/package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy compiled output from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

# If you need other runtime files (config, locales...), copy them explicitly
# COPY --from=builder /app/config ./config

# Expose default port (can be overridden with -e PORT=... when running)
EXPOSE 3000
